# Techniques

## PCA
transform observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables, called principal components.
By using PCA, dimensionality reduction of the data is achieved while preserving its variance.

## Singular Value Decomposition
technique used to simplify the values within an array by decomposing the array into its component parts to facilitate calculations with that array.

SVD is particularly useful when dealing with big data.
## T-SNE
improved version of SNE for compute. Large emphasis on local structure, less so on global structure

## UMAP

## Feature extraction
Combine features into a single new feature by applying a (learned) function

## Feature selection
Select a subset of features
