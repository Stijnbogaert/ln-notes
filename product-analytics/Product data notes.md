# Product data pipeline

The product data can be described as the data generated by users interacting with the product:

- user action logs  
- api usage metadata  
- company configuration  
- ...

This is the data we can leverage to measure the performance of the product, check for assumptions and evaluate experiments. The broad scope of the what and where of this data introduces friction to use it. The goal of the product data pipeline is to reduce this friction by consolidating the platform data across different tools and regions into a single point of entry. The pipeline keeps as close to the raw data as possible while increasing the convenience of working with the data.

## The setup (WIP)

Currently, the data pipeline consists of the following parts:

 - A job that runs once every day on each region to export the region specific data  
 - A job that runs once every day consolidating the region data and the data generated by global tools

The data is stored in a collection of tabular data files (csv) for each day, compressed and archived.

### Regional data

- db data, currently limited to the core database  
- prometheus data from the api's

###   
Global data

- mixpanel events  
- Hubspot exports (depricated)

### Data client

The pipeline transforms the data as little as possible to avoid opinionating the data already before any analysis can be made. There should be multiple subscribers on this data:  
- Product-dev teams to set up experiments, find bottlenecks, ...  
- A reporting service to measure the global health  
- ...

Disclaimer

Both the pipeline and the client are still a work in progress. Feadback is welcome and can be reported to Stijn Bogaert
