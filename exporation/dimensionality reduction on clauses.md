The embeddings of clauses are calculated by using a general text embeddings model. Since clauses are only a small subset of natural language the whole embedding could be sparse. This leads to more compute intensive post processing. [[dimensionality reduction|Reducing the dimensionality]] saves memory and compute.

Using unsupervised techniques could be used to project the clause embeddings into a smaller subspace.
